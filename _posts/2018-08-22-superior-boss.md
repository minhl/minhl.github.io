# Choose A Boss

Choose a boss, not a job. A boss that supports you, trusts you and
belives in you will make a great different in your career.


## A boss must be SUPERIOR:

- [ ] **S** upportive
- [ ] **U** nderstanding
- [ ] **P** rotective
- [ ] **E** mpowering
- [ ] **R** espectful
- [ ] **I** nspiring
- [ ] **O** pen-minded
- [ ] **R** eassuring

I was not qualified for the first management job I took. My boss took a big leap of faith to hire me.

I know I was not qualified, and acted as such. I avoid making mistakes at all costs, and tried to control everything because mistakes would be less likely. My people was not happy.

My boss called me into his office, asked me to close the door and said, "Oleg, I want you to make sizable mistakes, at least 5 mistakes every week for the period of next month or so."

I was shocked at first, and then liberated next.

My creativity, initiative, and energy were unleashed. My boss was brilliant, he knew that the fear of making mistakes was holding me back.

Stop punishing people for mistakes, celerate the mistakes as learning experiences.

Be **SUPERIOR** - be someone people remember.
