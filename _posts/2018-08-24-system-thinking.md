## Everyting is a system

The elephant story is a reminder to approach life with empathy; to step

## System Thinking

- **Everything is a system**: a product, team, market, process, habit, personal routine.
- **To understand (and improve) the system**, you have understand each part, and how the parts connect.
- **If you can't see or experience the full system**, you need to create model to put it together.
